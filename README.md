# TutorMatch

**TutorMatch** is a modern platform designed to connect students and tutors, helping students find the right courses and tutors based on their needs. The platform allows filtering tutors by experience, subject, price, and geographical location. Students can take tests to assess their knowledge level and receive recommendations for suitable courses and tutors.
